        <p>I love reading story books. I like to read story books at my free time. My favourite books are of Gernimo Stiltion. My hobby is reading interesting and imaginary books in my free time. Whenever I came back to home from school, I prefer to read such books after completing my home work. I am 11 years old and study in class 6th. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make anyone a better Human Being.</p>

        <p> I love Spiderman because he is Super Hero whose powers are original and life saving. Spiderman with all his powers always saves the city and people in it. All evil doers and wicked people are defeated by Spiderman and they fear Spiderman a lot.</p>
